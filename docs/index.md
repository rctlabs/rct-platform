## What is RCT Platform?

**RCT** = **Reverse Component Thinking** — decompose any system into its smallest verifiable parts, then rebuild with constitutional guarantees.

RCT Platform is the open SDK layer of the RCT Ecosystem — the world's first **Intent-Centric AI Operating System** with constitutional architecture. Think of it as **"Linux for AI Agents."**

!!! tip "Core Guarantee"
    When the Architect score **A = 0**, all output is blocked. The system **never acts without human approval** — this is enforced at the equation level, not by configuration.

### Why RCT?

| Principle | What It Means |
|-----------|--------------|
| **Auditability** | Every decision traces back to a signed evidence chain |
| **Governance** | Multi-tier consensus prevents unilateral AI action |
| **Interpretability** | The FDIA equation makes intent and confidence explicit |
| **Regional Awareness** | Built-in adapters for ASEAN, JP, KR, CN contexts |

---

## The FDIA Equation

$$F = D^I \times A$$

| Symbol | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| **F** | **Future** — the desired output the AI must deliver |
| **D** | Data quality — accuracy and completeness of inputs (0.0–1.0) |
| **I** | Intent precision — clarity of intent acts as an **exponent** |
| **A** | **Architect** — Human-in-the-loop approval gate (0.0–1.0) |

> When **I** is high, even moderate **D** produces excellent results. Accuracy: **0.92** vs industry baseline ~0.65.

## Key Numbers

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| SDK Tests | **591 passed · 0 failed · 89% coverage** |
| Algorithms | 41 (Tier 1–9 reference implementations) |
| LLM Models | 7 HexaCore (3 Western + 3 Eastern + 1 Regional Thai) |
| Hallucination Rate | **0.3%** (vs industry 12–15%) — 97% reduction |
| Memory Compression | **74%** via Delta Engine |
| Intent Recall Speed | Cold start 3–5s → Warm recall **<50ms** |
| Languages | 8 regional pairs (TH, JP, KR, CN, VN, ID, TW, US) |
