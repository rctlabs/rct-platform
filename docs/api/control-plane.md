# Control Plane API

The Control Plane exposes a FastAPI-based REST interface for intent compilation, graph building, and policy evaluation.

**Base URL (local dev):** `http://localhost:8000`  
**OpenAPI spec:** `http://localhost:8000/docs`

## Python Client

```python
import httpx

with httpx.Client(base_url="http://localhost:8000") as client:
    # Health check
    r = client.get("/health")
    assert r.status_code == 200

    # Compile intent
    r = client.post("/compile", json={
        "intent_text": "Refactor payment module",
        "domain": "backend",
        "architect_constraint": "Keep existing API contract",
        "requirements": "Tests pass, no regressions",
    })
    result = r.json()
    print(f"Score: {result['fdia_score']}")
```

## Authentication

The SDK control plane has no authentication by default — it is intended for local development and reference use. For production deployments in the Enterprise stack, JWT-based auth and mTLS are added at the Gateway layer.
